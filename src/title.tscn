                    Turtle Game AKA
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A turtle is a type of reptile characterized by its 
distinctive physical features, including a bony
or cartilaginous shell that encases its body, a
relatively short and stout build, and webbed
feet or flippers. Turtles are members of the
order Testudines and are known for their
slow and deliberate movement both on land
and in water. The most defining feature of a 
turtle is its shell, which consists of two main
parts: the upper portion called the carapace
and the lower portion known as the plastron.
The shell serves as a protective shield, 
offering defense against predators and
environmental hazards. Turtles are unique
among reptiles in that they cannot retract
their limbs or heads completely into their shells;
instead, they have adapted to have various
degrees of mobility within the shell. Turtles are
a diverse group, with many different species
inhabiting various environments, including
terrestrial (land-dwelling), aquatic (water-
dwelling), and semi-aquatic habitats. They have
a wide range of diets, from herbivorous to
omnivorous and carnivorous, depending on the
species. Turtles are found on almost every
continent and have adapted to a variety of
ecosystems, from deserts to tropical rainforests
to oceans. Turtles have been around for
millions of years and are considered one of the
oldest surviving reptile groups on Earth. They
have a fascinating evolutionary history and
are of scientific and conservation significance
due to their unique characteristics
                  and ecological roles."
